Hello

Considering that we didn't really have anything at the presentation, we decided it would be appropriate to attach some of our work to the submission. It's really messy and half of the files are irrelevant but if you really want to play around, you can run runme.m and then check if the indices correspond to the correct images in haystack{} (this is where the list of images is loaded).

Thanks :)
